Here are the general steps for creating a C++ video game:

1. Game Loop Structure:
- Create main loop that continuously runs while game is active
- Handle player input
- Update game state
- Render graphics to screen

2. Essential Components:
- Window Management (using SDL, SFML, or similar)
- Input Handler
- Game State Manager
- Asset Manager (textures, sounds, etc.)
- Rendering System
- Physics/Collision System (if needed)
- Audio System

3. Basic Implementation Steps:
a) Initialize Libraries and Window:
- Set up chosen graphics library
- Create game window
- Initialize renderer

b) Create Game Class Structure:
- Define main game class
- Include necessary member variables
- Create methods for core functionality

c) Implement Game Objects:
- Create base game object class
- Define common properties
- Create specific object classes

4. Additional Considerations:
- Frame rate management
- Resource management
- Memory management
- Error handling
- Game state transitions
- Scene management

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects?
